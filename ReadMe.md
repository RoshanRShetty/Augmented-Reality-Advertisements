### Basic Idea

With all the research going on in the field of Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality, added by faster internet speeds at cheaper costs, it is very likely, that AR/VR devices will flood the market. This application is just one of the way, we can tap into the AR domain commercially. The basic idea in development of this app was to provide a way to embedd virtual information in the physical world. 

### Software Used

 - Unity Game Engine,
 - Vuporia AR Libraries.
 
### Working

The application works on 'Marker Based AR', where a marker can be any 2D image or 3D object, that can be uniquely distinguisehd.
These markers are preloaded to the application and each marker is tied to some virtual information. The follwing image shows the general architecture of the application.

The Camera forwards the information scanned to the Application. The Application scans the information for any markers. As soon as a marker is identified, the application processes the marker to get it's associated data and displays this information to the user via the screen.(If the information is an audio file, it gets played in the speaker).

### Advantages
- Saves space, No need for huge billboards. A small marker can display all the information necessary.
- Saves cost, No need for manual change of advertisements. Update the software to display different information for teh same marker.
- Saves Ink, paper, electricity, Everythings Digital :)


### The Way Forward

As internet speed becomes faster and cheaper, we can implmenet the application in real time such that marker identification can be done online and information be sent to the user just in time.

We can also use GPS based ad's, that tracks the user's GPS location and shows him ads for the vicinity bussinesses.
